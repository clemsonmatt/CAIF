                            As you may know, most Americans carefully observe
                            the time that is set for people to meet. Please
                            try to be on time and be sure to call if you have
                            to change the time or have to cancel the
                            appointment.

                            you get together with your friendship partner, you need

                            Americans are usually very "friendly" and will

                            Americans often indicate their interest in
                            others by asking questions. This indicates
                            an eagerness to learn about you and your

                            your residence. Many Americans feel that
                            arriving late for appointments or events
                            indicates rudeness or lact of respect when

                             Some Americans, especially if well-acquainted,
                             will greet each other with a hug. If you do
