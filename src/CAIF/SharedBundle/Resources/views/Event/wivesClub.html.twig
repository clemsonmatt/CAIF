                    The CAIF International Wives Club was organized to help international ladies get connected with other females.  All ladies, both married and single, are welcome to attend, as well as your young children.  We meet generally on the first and third Fridays of the month, typically from 10 a.m. until noon.  Location for each meeting is posted on the calendar of events.   At each meeting, we offer a topic of interest: crafting, cooking classes, household management ideas, shopping helps, parenting tips, etc.  Each lady brings a lunch dish to share with the group.
