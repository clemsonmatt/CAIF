                The CAIF International Wives Club was organized to help international wives get connected with other international and American wives.  Children are welcome. We meet generally on the first and third Fridays of the month, typically from 10 a.m. until noon. Location for each meeting is posted on the calendar of events. At each meeting, we offer a topic of interest: crafting, cooking classes, household management ideas, shopping helps, parenting tips, cultural sharing, etc.  Snacks are provided.    Each semester's events are posted on the events tab.  To have your name added to the group email list, please contact Alana Varner at alanavarner@gmail.com
